# Zaiah Ventures - Brand & Design Guide

## Brand Identity

Zaiah Ventures is the holding company for Zach Garner's portfolio of businesses. It is an entity, not a personal brand. The site should communicate "real business" - not side projects, not a freelancer portfolio, not a 25-year-old creative's personal page. The authority comes from restraint and confidence, not from selling or proving.

## Typography System

Three fonts, each with a specific role:

| Font | Role | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| **Space Grotesk** (600) | Parent company identity | "Zaiah Ventures" brand mark, footer LLC, "Business Portfolio" label |
| **DM Serif Display** (400) | Business names + hero tagline | Company headings (h3), tagline (h2) |
| **DM Sans** (400, 500) | Body text + UI | Descriptions, category labels |

The parent company and its children have completely different typographic voices. This is intentional - Zaiah Ventures should never blend in with its portfolio companies.

## Color System

| Color | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Teal | `#0e7a8f` | Zaiah Ventures brand only - brand mark, "Business Portfolio" label, footer |
| Warm accent | `#8a7150` | Portfolio company category labels ("Fine Art", "Coaching", "Technology"), domain hover state |
| Dark text | `#2a2a2a` | Headings, primary text |
| Gray text | `#888` / `#999` | Body descriptions, hero subtitle |
| Light gray | `#c5c0b8` / `#bbb` / `#ccc` | Domain links, muted text |
| Border | `#e0ddd7` | All horizontal/vertical rules |
| Background | `#fcfbf9` | Page background (warm off-white, NOT pure white) |

The teal is exclusively for the parent entity. It never appears on the portfolio companies. The warm accent is exclusively for the portfolio layer. This separation is what makes the hierarchy readable.

## Layout

- Max width: 1080px, centered
- Three-column grid for businesses, divided by vertical rules (not cards, not boxes)
- Coaching always in the center column
- Hero section: brand mark, tagline, description, then "Business Portfolio" label tight above the border
- No cards, no boxes, no "Visit" buttons - these look like ads
- No LinkedIn link (only represents AI work currently)
- No location / address
- No contact email on the page (spam magnet, not needed for validation)

## Copy Structure

### Hero
1. **Brand mark**: "Zaiah Ventures" (Space Grotesk, teal)
2. **Tagline**: Lists the three areas. Currently: "Depth coaching, fine art photography, and AI engineering." Order is intentional - does NOT match column order, gives a different first impression.
3. **Description**: What the entity is and what connects the businesses. Should NOT repeat the tagline's list.

### Each Business Column
Three sentences, each doing specific work:
1. **Tagline** - what it is
2. **Proprietary/unique callout** - what makes it distinct
3. **Customer focus** - who it's for

### Copy Principles
- Short descriptions looked cheap/empty. Medium-length (3 sentences) is the right weight.
- Don't list credentials or years of experience in a resume-like way ("Two decades spanning..." is OK, "20 years of experience in..." is not)
- No try-hard adjectives: avoid "rare", "deep", "unique", "cutting-edge"
- No em dashes. Regular hyphens only.
- Don't oversell what isn't earned yet. If there are no awards, don't imply there are. The copy should get more true over time, not less.
- "Depth-oriented" is fine. "Depth coaching" is fine for the tagline. Don't repeat "depth" elsewhere.
- Watch for word repetition across sentences within each column.

## Design Principles

- **Light color schemes only.** Zach strongly dislikes dark themes. Always warm off-white or white backgrounds.
- **Minimalism means every element matters.** Don't add things to fill space - but don't strip so far that it looks empty/cheap either.
- **Authority through restraint, not decoration.** No gradients, no parallax, no animations, no hover effects beyond subtle color transitions on domains.
- **This is a holding company, not a personal page.** The businesses should feel like independent entities, not "Zach's projects." Frame as "operates" or "portfolio of businesses," not "my work" or "my ventures."
- **No cards or boxes around the businesses.** Cards with borders + CTAs look like display ads. Vertical rules between columns are the right treatment.
- **The page exists for business validation** (Apple Developer, payment processors, etc.), not for lead generation. Keep it clean and legitimate. Individual venture sites handle their own marketing.

## What's Missing / Future Updates

- Photography: Zach has 15 years of craft but hasn't packaged it into a positioning story yet. When awards, editions, or the book happen, the middle sentence of the photography column is where that goes.
- AI: The framing may shift depending on whether Zach is consulting vs. employed. "For companies building with AI at scale" works for both.
- Coaching: The Cognizant Framework is the strongest positioning asset across all three businesses. It's proprietary, named, and in development.
- No favicon yet.
- Domain: needs to be purchased and pointed at hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, etc.)
